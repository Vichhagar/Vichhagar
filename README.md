Hi there, I'm a full stack developer with a passion for learning and a curious mind. I have a particular interest in artificial intelligence and machine learning, as well as electrical engineering. In my free time, you'll find me with my nose buried in a book, always eager to expand my knowledge and understanding of the world.
